# Sample size calculator

### Small app to calculate sample sizes for z- and t- tests with equal sample sizes and sd's using one-tailed probability

Power of Z-tests is set to 80% and p value can be set to 0.05 or 0.01

In t-tests this values can be set manually 

One sample Z test:
$\frac{(Z_2-Z_1)\sigma}{(\mu_1-\mu_2)}^2=n$

Two sample Z test:
$2/\frac{d}{Z_2-Z_1)\sigma}^2=n$

One sample t test:
$\frac{(t_1-t_2)sd}{d}^2=n$

Two sample t test:
$2/\frac{d}{(t_1-t_2)sd}^2=n$
